PROJECT GOAL
The goal of this project is to gather information from UW-Madison courses database and use statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be meaningful to the school/department in terms of performance.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS and SQL REQUIREMENTS
Query the database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis to test the following hypotheses.
Import static files (i.e. .csv) into a PostgreSQL database to pull out relevant data from a relational database prior to statistical analysis.

1.Test to see if course instructors affect the ratio of A grades.
2.Test to see if the average grade among students who take online courses is lower than the rest of the students.
3.Test to see there is a difference between lecture classes of different number of students in terms of average grades.
4.Test to see if there is a difference between grades offered in Fall term and those in Spring term.

Note that for the purpose of this analysis, all courses are pooled together.
